This is a git repository of undergrad math notes by Snochi. All notes are provided as raw LaTeX files, and one has to compile them (not really) to obtain PDF files. The solpack package, which is used for every file in this repository, is a custom LaTeX written by myself, and can be found at here: https://github.com/snochi/solpack.git.
